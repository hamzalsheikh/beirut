    <h3>Oldest Mosque in Lebanon </h3>
    <p>Before being eclipsed by the Mohammad al-Amin Mosque, the Omari Mosque was Beirutâ€™s central mosque. It takes its name from the caliph Omar Ibn aI-Khattab. It was built on the ruins of an ancient Byzantine church that was in turn built on the ruins of Roman thermal baths. The Crusaders transformed the mosque in 1150 into a cathedral dedicated to St. John, before the Mamluks definitively turned it into a mosque in 1291, becoming the grand mosque of the city during the reign of Sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil.</p>
